# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a UFC prediction project containing two main data files:
- `ufc-master.csv`: UFC fight data with fighter statistics, odds, and match results
- `fighter-features.txt`: Notes on fighter attributes and features to consider

## Data Structure

The dataset contains comprehensive UFC fight data with the following key attributes:
- Fighter information (Red/Blue fighters, stance, height, reach, weight, age)
- Fight statistics (significant strikes, takedowns, submissions)
- Historical performance (win/loss streaks, fight records)
- Betting odds and expected values
- Fight outcomes and finish details

## Common Development Tasks

Since this appears to be a data analysis project without code files yet, typical workflows would involve:
- Data analysis and exploration using Python/pandas
- Machine learning model development for fight prediction
- Statistical analysis of fighter performance metrics
- Visualization of fight trends and outcomes

## Data Features Available

Key fighter metrics include:
- Style and wrestling background
- Ground game strength and time spent on ground
- Striking statistics and defense
- Submission attempts and wins
- Historical fight outcomes and methods
- Physical attributes (height, reach, weight)
- Current win/loss streaks
- Ranking information across weight classes

## Project Structure

Currently a minimal structure with:
- Raw data files for UFC fights and fighter features
- No existing code structure or dependencies
- Ready for data science/ML development setup
